# Study Drills
# Go online and find out what Python's raw_input does.  allows for keyboard input
# Can you find other ways to use it? Try some of the samples you find. 
# Write another "form" like this to ask some other questions.
# Related to escape sequences, try to find out why the last line has '6\'2"'
# with that \' sequence. See how the single-quote needs to be escaped because otherwise it would end the string?
